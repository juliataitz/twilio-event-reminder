###What do we want to do?

Send important text message reminders when you sign up through facebook.

###How are we doing this? 

An Event (organized events or birthdays) is considered important, if people who are close to you are participating.

For now there could be three different ways of figuring out why someone is important to you

1. You literally select the people who are important to you.
2. We use Facebooks friends lists like Family, close Friends, etc. to tell who's important and who isn't.
3. We use Facebooks relationship algorithm to know who you like/stalk/is important to you.

###What are we going to use?

- OAuth 2.0 (Facebook login)
- Facebook API (determin important people)
- Twilio API (send out sms reminders)
